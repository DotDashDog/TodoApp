## Technologies
### React 
React is a front-end JavaScript framework that allows HTML and Javascript to be modularized and contained. It also allows for highly organized state to be associated with each HTML component, rather than as a part of a larger HTML file. 

### Redux
Redux is a client store technology that allows for easy data sharing and updating between React components. A problem with vanilla React is that it creates a natural tree-like structure, which can make it difficult to share data with other branches. Redux circumvents that by making one central store that all React components can access.

### Webpack
Webpack bundles your code into a single JavaScript file that allows for cross-platform, cross-generational code to automatically be updated to suite your needs. It is able to parse a multitude of file types. In this package, it is used for SCSS, CSS, and JSON, as well as ES6 JavaScript syntax.
